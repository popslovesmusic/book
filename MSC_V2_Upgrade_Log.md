# MSC V2 Upgrade Log

## Summary Diff
- Added formal MSC functional and stability integral.
- Added canonical regime table with stability, memory, and DFVM responses.
- Added explicit MSC↔DFVM coupling law, identity attractor clarification, entropy linkage, and failure mode matrix.
<<<<<<< ours
=======
- Added a Sobolev-space exemplar with illustrative $\rho_{rel}$ and $\sigma_{pert}$ functionals and norm-based regime thresholding to keep $S_{MSC}$ finite and computable.
>>>>>>> theirs

## RMF Compliance
- RMF scan rerun internally post-edit; no violations detected.
- All non-essentialist, relational constraints remain intact; no ontological constraints were removed.
