# MSC V2 Upgrade Log

## Summary Diff
- Added formal MSC functional and stability integral.
- Added canonical regime table with stability, memory, and DFVM responses.
- Added explicit MSC↔DFVM coupling law, identity attractor clarification, entropy linkage, and failure mode matrix.

## RMF Compliance
- RMF scan rerun internally post-edit; no violations detected.
- All non-essentialist, relational constraints remain intact; no ontological constraints were removed.
