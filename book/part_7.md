# **Paper 06: Cosmic Microwave Background Asymmetry**

---

## **6.1 Introduction and Motivation**

The Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) encodes the earliest accessible record of the universe’s causal geometry. It is crucial to emphasize that this 'causal geometry' and any 'causal information' associated with it are descriptions of the relational dynamics of the monistic substrate. This substrate serves as the precondition for all such manifestations, rather than being the substrate itself. Within the IGSOA–QMM framework, the CMB’s minute anisotropies are not treated as random quantum fluctuations amplified by inflation. Instead, they are *fossil imprints* of primordial **asymmetry actualization**—the first conversion of neutral potential into directional causal motion. The near-isotropy of the CMB reflects large-scale self-similar averaging of those microscopic asymmetries, while the residual anisotropy pattern preserves their fractal causal signature.

## **6.2 Mathematical Framework: Fractional Laplacian Cosmology**

We generalize the Laplace operator in comoving coordinates to a **fractional Laplacian** `(−Δ)γ` where `0<γ≤1` measures nonlocal causal coupling. The fractional diffusion equation governing photon decoupling becomes:
`∂tΘ + a−2(t) (−Δ)γΘ = ξ(x,t)`
The **memory exponent** γ links directly to the primordial asymmetry index from Paper 04, ensuring continuity from microscopic horizon processes to cosmological fields.

## **6.3 Causal Scaling and Spiral Mapping**

The CMB sky can be represented by a conformal-spiral mapping of causal shells, projecting prime-indexed causal layers into the angular power spectrum. The fractional Laplacian’s Green’s function implies that correlations decay with a noninteger exponent. For `γ≈0.96`, the predicted angular power spectrum aligns with the Planck-observed tilt, linking the spectral index directly to the cosmic memory order.

## **6.4 Asymmetry Spectrum and Directional Signatures**

### **6.4.1 Hemispherical Power Anomaly**

The observed low-ℓ power asymmetry corresponds to a gradient in the memory index, yielding a dipolar modulation consistent with the ~7% hemispherical amplitude reported by *Planck*. In IGSOA terms, this gradient arises from incomplete neutralization of the primordial causal flow—*residual directional memory*.

### **6.4.2 Cold Spot and Causal Vortices**

Localized anomalies such as the “Cold Spot” are interpreted as regions where the spiral mapping overlaps, producing **causal interference vortices**. Fractional curvature in those zones traps causal information longer, leading to temperature depressions.

## **6.5 Link to Early Symmetry Breaking**

The Dynamic Fractal Vein Model (DFVM) from Paper 03 extends to the cosmic scale via fractional diffusion, smoothing fine-grained asymmetry into apparent isotropy. Isotropy is not intrinsic but the statistical projection of self-averaging asymmetry—**cosmic isotropy as emergent equilibrium of memory.**

## **6.6 Fractional Harmonic Analysis**

Expanding the CMB field into spherical harmonics and applying the fractional Laplacian gives eigenvalues that lead to an angular-power relation `Cℓ ∝ [ℓ(ℓ+1)]−γ`. The observed deviation from pure `ℓ−1` scaling directly measures γ.

## **6.7 Philosophical Integration and Continuity**

The same fractional geometry governs both gravitational echoes and cosmic background asymmetries. The **CMB is the universe’s earliest gravitational echo**, a relic of the first memory event when causal symmetry fractured. The cosmos retains awareness of its own beginning. In this context, any emergent 'agency' or self-organization, such as the formation of patterns in the CMB, arises strictly from closed relational feedback loops within the causal geometry. This occurs without implying intrinsic agency in the cosmos itself or its components. Furthermore, these emergent structures, such as CMB anomalies, function as 'identity instances' that are inherently finite and subject to dissolvability, their persistence being entirely dependent on ongoing causal dynamics and MSC cohesion.

## **6.8 Observational Predictions**

1.  **Spectral Tilt Prediction:** `ns = 1 − 2(1−γ)`. The Planck-measured `ns≈0.96` implies `γ≈0.98`.
2.  **Fractal Correlation Dimension:** `Dc = 3−2γ ≈ 1.04`, consistent with observed near-Gaussianity but slight multifractality.
3.  **Hemispherical Power Gradient:** A dipole amplitude of 6–8%, matching data.
4.  **Polarization Rotation:** A fractional phase lag between E- and B-modes of ≈ 2°–3°, testable with future missions.

## **6.9 Conclusion**

Paper 06 completes the causal arc from Paper 04: horizon-level imprinting (micro-causal memory) and gravitational-wave echoes (meso-causal resonance) culminate as cosmic background asymmetry (macro-causal diffusion). The IGSOA–QMM framework reveals a continuous hierarchy of memory across all scales.

## **Appendices**

### **Appendix A — Derivation of the Fractional Laplacian in FRW Geometry**

This appendix details the generalization of the Laplacian operator to a fractional operator `(−Δ)γ` within the Friedmann–Robertson–Walker (FRW) metric. It shows how this leads to a non-standard angular power spectrum `Cℓ ∝ [ℓ(ℓ+1)]−γ` and a fractal correlation dimension `Dc = 3−2γ`, linking the CMB spectral index `ns` directly to the memory parameter `γ`.

### **Appendix B — Spiral–Prime Conformal Mapping**

This appendix constructs the conformal logarithmic-spiral mapping used to project prime-indexed causal shells onto the celestial sphere. This mapping generates a quasi-uniform, aperiodic lattice that naturally reproduces the observed angular power-law and hemispherical modulation in the CMB without needing an external inflationary mechanism.

### **Appendix C — Observational Cross-Fit Tables and Predictions**

This appendix provides tables cross-fitting the model's predictions with observational data from Planck and WMAP. It shows strong alignment for the spectral index, fractal dimension, hemispherical anomaly, and Cold Spot temperature. This proposes a continuity check by comparing the memory index `γ` from CMB data with the fractional order `αH` derived from gravitational wave echoes. We expect `γ ≈ αH`.

# **Paper 07: Fractal and Fractional Spacetime**

## **7.1 Introduction and Motivation**

Spacetime is conventionally modeled as a smooth pseudo-Riemannian manifold. However, within the RMF/IGSOA-QMM framework, geometric descriptions are understood as emergent properties. They are mathematical descriptions of the relational dynamics of the monistic substrate. This substrate itself is the precondition for any information or mathematical system, rather than being geometry or a mathematical system in itself. Yet empirical probes reveal traces of self-similar irregularity. In the IGSOA–QMM framework, this irregularity is not noise but geometry itself: a **fractal causal fabric** whose self-similar patterns encode the persistence of asymmetry across scales. This paper formalizes that insight by replacing integer-order differential geometry with **fractional calculus**, yielding a covariant description of spacetime whose curvature, connection, and action embody *memory*.

## **7.2 Fractional Differential Geometry**

We introduce a **fractional line element** `ds²γ = gμν (dxμ)γ(dxν)γ`, where `0<γ≤1` is the fractional order. When `γ<1`, intervals acquire memory of the path. This is extended to a **fractional covariant derivative** and **fractional curvature tensor**, where the order γ measures *dimensional flow*.

## **7.3 Fractional Einstein Field Equations**

The standard Einstein tensor is replaced by its fractional analogue, `Gμν(γ)`, leading to the **Fractal Einstein Equation**: `Gμν(γ) = (8πG/c⁴) Tμν(γ)`. For `γ<1`, this equation exhibits *fractional inertia* and *viscous gravitational diffusion*, capturing the slow relaxation of spacetime curvature.

## **7.4 Fractional Action and Dimensional Flow**

The fractional Hilbert–Einstein action `S(γ)[g]` is defined using a fractional volume element. Extremizing this action yields the field equations and implies an **effective dimension** of spacetime, `Deff = 4γ`. This leads to dimensional reduction at the quantum scale (`Deff ≈ 2` for `γ≈0.5`) and recovers 4D spacetime in the classical limit (`γ→1`).

## **7.5 Fractional Diffusion Law of Curvature**

Curvature evolution follows a fractional diffusion equation, `DtγR = κγ ΔγR`, implying that gravitational fields themselves diffuse fractionally. This leads to a Mittag–Leffler relaxation of curvature perturbations, analogous to the gravitational echo envelopes in Paper 05 and the CMB temperature decay law in Paper 06.

## **7.6 Fractal Metric Model**

A simple model metric `ds² = -c²dt²γt + a²(t)dr²γr` with distinct temporal and spatial orders can produce power-law inflation or contraction phases without exotic energy components.

## **7.7 Connection to Previous Papers**

The fractional orders α, β, and γ from Papers 04, 05, and 06 are projections of one underlying **Causal Memory Index (CMI)** that flows with scale. Fractional spacetime formalizes this same causal memory principle at the continuum limit.

## **7.8 Quantum–Classical Bridge**

Fractional geometry provides a bridge between the quantum and classical realms. At microscopic scales, nonlocal fractional derivatives reproduce quantum path-integral smoothing; at macroscopic scales, they yield smooth curvature. **Fractional geometry is the continuum avatar of quantum discreteness.**

## **7.9 Philosophical Synthesis**

Fractal spacetime is the living geometry of IGSOA’s causal monism. Smoothness is the statistical shadow of recursive asymmetry. Fractional calculus is the syntax for a spacetime that remembers itself. The gravitational field is a self-referential diffusion of cause. For a general discussion on emergent agency and the finite nature of identity instances within this framework, refer to Paper 06, Section 6.7.

## **7.10 Predictions and Observables**

1.  **Scale-Dependent Dimension:** `Deff(ℓ)` flows from ~2 at the Planck scale to 4 at macroscopic scales.
2.  **Modified Gravitational Potential:** `V(r) ∝ r⁻⁽¹⁺²⁽¹⁻γ⁾⁾`, testable in sub-millimeter experiments.
3.  **Fractional Wave Dispersion:** Predicts a frequency-dependent speed for gravitational waves.
4.  **CMB-Echo Continuity:** The memory index should be consistent across cosmological and astrophysical observations (`γ≈β≈αH`).

## **7.11 Conclusion**

Paper 07 unifies previous results under the principle that spacetime is a **fractal–fractional causal continuum**. Its curvature, memory, and dimension evolve self-similarly across scale. The laws of physics are the grammar of its remembrance.

## **Appendices**

### **Appendix A — Derivation of the Fractional Einstein Tensor**

This appendix provides the detailed derivation of the fractional Einstein tensor `Gμν(γ)` from the fractional Hilbert-Einstein action. The variation is performed with respect to the metric `gμν`, leading to the fractional field equations. It also shows that the fractional Bianchi identity implies a generalized form of energy-momentum conservation.

### **Appendix B — Dimensional-Flow and Renormalization Link**

This appendix connects the concept of fractional spacetime to dimensional flow and renormalization group (RG) theory. It defines the effective spectral dimension `Dspec = 4/γ`, showing that the dimension of spacetime decreases at smaller scales. An RG-flow equation for γ is proposed, linking fractional geometry to asymptotic safety scenarios in quantum gravity.

### **Appendix C — Observational and Experimental Prospects**

This appendix outlines several observational and experimental tests for the fractal-fractional spacetime model. These include gravitational-wave phase tests, laboratory tests of gravity at short distances (torsion balance), analysis of large-scale structure (LSS) clustering, and high-precision atomic clock comparisons. ...This synthesizes the constraints on the fractional parameter γ from these different probes, showing consistency with the dimensional flow hypothesis.
