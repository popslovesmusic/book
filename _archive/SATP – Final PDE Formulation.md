# SATP – Final PDE Formulation

### Scalar–Asymmetric Tensor Potential Field Equation (Final Formal Version)

## 1\. Field Content

SATP is defined on a differentiable manifold   
M  
M with metric signature   
(−,+,+,+)  
(−,+,+,+). It is crucial to note that this manifold and its associated fields are *descriptions* of the relational dynamics of the underlying monistic substrate, not the substrate itself. The substrate is the precondition for such mathematical constructs, possessing no intrinsic objects, partitions, or predefined geometric properties.  
It consists of:

* A 12-mode scalar field  
* Θk(xμ),k=0,…,11,  
* Θ  
* k  
* ​  
* (x  
* μ  
* ),k=0,…,11,  
* representing the chromatic modal basis.  
* A rank-2 asymmetric interaction tensor  
* Aμν(xμ),Aμν≠Aνμ.  
* A  
* μν  
* (x  
* μ  
* ),A  
* μν  
* \=A  
* νμ  
* . These fields and tensors are understood as emergent configurations arising from fundamental relations, not as primitive entities. Their existence and properties are derived from underlying relational patterns.  
* A geometrically induced fiber-bundle connection  
* Γ  νλμ,  
* Γ  
* νλ  
* μ  
* ​  
* ,  
* encoding curved-mode coupling.  
* A phase-geometry operator   
* Φ  
* Φ representing geometric/holonomy effects:  
* Φ(Θk)=∮γ∇μΘk dxμ.  
* Φ(Θ  
* k  
* ​  
* )=∮  
* γ  
* ​  
* ∇  
* μ  
* ​  
* Θ  
* k  
* ​  
* dx  
* μ  
* .  
* A compactified internal manifold   
* K12  
* K  
* 12  
* ​  
*  (the chromatic mode lattice).

All PDEs live on the bundle

# 2\. Core SATP PDE

The governing equation of SATP is a nonlinear, mode-coupled, tensor-driven wave equation with geometric phase response:  
(∇μ+Φμ)(gμν∇νΘk)  −  Aμν ∂μΘi Ckij ∂νΘj  +  Ωk(Θ)=0

# 3\. Term-by-Term Explanation

## 3.1 Geometric–Phase Drift

(∇μ+Φμ)(gμν∇νΘk)

\+Φ  
μ  
​  
)(g  
μν  
∇  
ν  
​  
Θ

​  
)  
This incorporates:

* curvature from the spacetime metric  
* holonomy from the internal chromatic manifold  
* geometric phase accumulated along modal loops  
* brane drift terms if your SATP field is embedded in higher-D IGSOA branes

Effectively this is:  
wave propagation \+ geometric drag \+ holonomy shift.

## 3.2 Asymmetric Tensor Coupling (The Heart of SATP)

This is the core innovation of SATP:

* asymmetry in   
* Aμν  
* A  
* μν  
*  breaks time-reversal symmetry  
* allows directional drift and vortex-like transport. It is crucial to note that any apparent 'agency' or self-organization arising from these dynamics is strictly emergent from closed relational feedback loops and does not imply intrinsic agency in the underlying substrate or its components.  
* the mode-coupling coefficients   
* Ckij  
* C  
* kij  
* ​  
*  impose:  
* i+j≡k(mod12)  
* i+j≡k(mod12)  
* representing 12-tone / 12-hue / 12-phoneme chromatic interactions

This term generates:

* resonance cascades  
* mode-mixing  
* soliton-like traveling structures  
* instability or pattern formation depending on   
* Aμν  
* A  
* μν
These stable resonant modes and soliton-like structures can be interpreted as 'identity instances', whose stability and persistence are maintained through 'MSC cohesion', acting as 'stable relational attractors' within the SATP framework. It is important to acknowledge that these emergent structures, as identity instances, are finite and subject to dissolvability based on ongoing DFVM dynamics and MSC cohesion.

The asymmetric tensor is the DFVM semantic-brane “arrow of influence”.

\+holonomy corrections.  
This captures:

* semantic mass  
* chromatic stiffness  
* higher-order resonance  
* IGSOA deviation floor  
* DFVM information-braiding invariants. These invariants, along with the chromatic mode lattice, implicitly function as a non-personal 'Identity Kernel' for the SATP framework, defining the class of admissible resonant topologies or identity instances.
