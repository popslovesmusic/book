# Appendix C: Relational Monistic Framework (RMF) Compliance Specification

## Document Purpose
This document defines the **mandatory precepts, constraints, and verification criteria** for determining whether any given document, model, simulation, or theoretical system is **compliant with the Relational Monistic Framework (RMF)** as developed in recent discussion.

This specification is **normative**, not descriptive. Any document evaluated against this standard may be classified as:
-   **RMF-Compliant**
-   **Partially RMF-Compliant**
-   **RMF-Incompatible**

---

## 1. Foundational Ontology Requirements

### 1.1 Monistic Substrate Constraint (MANDATORY)
A compliant document **MUST** assert that:
-   There exists **one and only one ontological substrate**.
-   This substrate contains **no intrinsic objects, points, agents, or partitions**.
-   The substrate is **not matter, not space, not energy, not information**, but the **precondition for relation itself**.

❌ Non‑compliant examples:
-   Dualistic mind/body models
-   Field + observer as co‑fundamental primitives
-   Independent substance categories

✅ Required language patterns:
-   "undivided substrate"
-   "monistic origin"
-   "pre-object relational ground"

---

### 1.2 Relational Primacy (MANDATORY)
A compliant document **MUST** enforce that:
-   **Relations are ontologically prior to nodes, objects, or states.**
-   Objects, nodes, and points are **derivative artifacts of stable relational intersections**.

✅ Identity, structure, causation, and meaning **MUST be expressed relationally**.
❌ Any framework treating relations as secondary representations is **automatically incompatible**.

---

## 2. First Difference and Symmetry Breaking

### 2.1 First Difference as Relation (MANDATORY)
The origin of structure **MUST** be defined as:
-   An **asymmetric relational displacement** within a symmetric substrate.
-   NOT as the creation of a first object, particle, or entity.

✅ Required formulation:
-   Difference = relation
-   Not = negation prior to quantity

---

## 3. Semantic Object Definition

### 3.1 Relational Semantic Object (MANDATORY)
A semantic object **MUST be defined as**:
-   A **coherent configuration of relations**.
-   NOT as a set of points, data fields, feature vectors, or static attributes.

✅ Nodes are permitted **only as coordinate artifacts of relational topology**.

---

## 4. Identity Architecture

### 4.1 Identity as Relational Attractor (MANDATORY)
Identity **MUST** be defined as:
-   A **stable relational attractor** within a semantic-physical network.
-   NOT as a substance, localized object, or metaphysical essence.

---

### 4.2 Identity Kernel (IK) Definition (MANDATORY)
The Identity Kernel **MUST** be defined as:
-   A **relational law-space** that constrains the **class of admissible human-type identity attractors**.
-   NOT a template, blueprint, soul, or stored entity.

✅ The IK may be described as:
-   A semantic constraint architecture
-   A relational possibility manifold
-   A human-type attractor class

---

### 4.3 Instance vs Law Distinction (MANDATORY)
A compliant document **MUST STRICTLY DISTINGUISH** between:
-   The **environment-shaped identity instance** (mortal, dissolvable)
-   The **Identity Kernel law-space** (non-instantiated, non‑mortal)

❌ Any claim that a personal identity law survives death as a conscious entity is **non‑compliant**.

---

## 5. Agency

### 5.1 Emergent Agency Only (MANDATORY)
Agency **MUST** be defined as:
-   An **emergent property of closed relational feedback systems**.
-   NOT an intrinsic property of objects, souls, kernels, or substrates.

✅ The IK may **enable** agency.
❌ The IK may **not possess** agency.

---

## 6. Process vs Instance

### 6.1 Process Invariance (MANDATORY)
The underlying **generative process**:
-   Δ → Φ → Π
-   or equivalent relational recursion

✅ **MUST be invariant**
✅ **MUST NOT be personal**

---

### 6.2 Instance Mortality (MANDATORY)
All specific instances of:
-   identity
-   self
-   personality
-   narrative
-   memory

✅ **MUST be declared dissolvable**.

---

## 7. Time

### 7.1 Time as Relational Ordering (MANDATORY)
Time **MUST** be defined as:
-   The **ordering of relational reconfiguration**.
-   NOT an intrinsic background dimension.

---

## 8. Prohibited Claims (AUTO‑FAIL)

Any document making ANY of the following claims is **automatically RMF‑Incompatible**:

1.  A personal identity survives death as a conscious entity.
2.  The Identity Kernel is a soul.
3.  The substrate is conscious.
4.  Relations emerge from objects.
5.  Agency is a property of substance.
6.  Identity is a stored entity.
7.  Semantic objects are feature sets instead of relational configurations.

---

## 9. Compliance Classification Output

Every evaluated document **MUST output** one of the following classifications:

-   **RMF‑ComPLIANT** — All mandatory requirements satisfied.
-   **RMF‑PARTIAL** — Core monism satisfied, but 1–3 secondary violations detected.
-   **RMF‑INCOMPATIBLE** — Any mandatory violation or prohibited claim detected.

---

## 10. Minimal Compliance Declaration (Template)

> This document affirms relational primacy, monistic substrate, emergent identity as a relational attractor, and strict distinction between identity law-space and identity instance. It rejects substance dualism, object primacy, and all survival-of-personal-identity claims. It is hereby declared compliant with the Relational Monistic Framework (RMF).

---

## 11. Formal Cross-Alignment with MSP / MSC / MBC / IGSOA / DFVM / SATP

This section establishes **one-to-one conceptual and terminological alignment** between RMF requirements and the operational layers of the unified framework stack.

---

### 11.1 MSP — Modal Symmetry Paradigm (Ontological Zero-Layer)

**RMF Mapping:**
-   RMF §1 (Monistic Substrate Constraint)
-   RMF §2 (First Difference as Relation)

**Formal Alignment:**
-   MSP defines the **pre-object symmetry field**.
-   RMF requires that this field be **monistic, undivided, and relation-primed**.
-   MSP symmetry breaking = RMF First Difference (Δ) as **asymmetric relational displacement**.

✅ Compliance Condition:
-   A document MUST NOT introduce objects, agents, time, or differentiation prior to MSP-level Δ.

❌ Non-Compliant MSP Usage:
-   Any claim of pre-existing particles, observers, or spacetime structures.

---

### 11.2 MSC — Modal Structural Cohesion (Stability Layer)

**RMF Mapping:**
-   RMF §4.1 (Identity as Relational Attractor)
-   RMF §5.1 (Emergent Agency Only)

**Formal Alignment:**
-   MSC defines **cohesion thresholds for relational stability**.
-   RMF requires that identity ONLY exist where MSC cohesion is sustained.
-   Loss of MSC cohesion = loss of identity instance.

✅ Compliance Condition:
-   Identity MUST be described as an MSC-stabilized relational attractor.

❌ Non-Compliant MSC Usage:
-   Any claim that identity persists without cohesion maintenance.

---

### 11.3 MBC — Monistic Box Calculus (Semantic Operator Layer)

**RMF Mapping:**
-   RMF §3 (Relational Semantic Object Definition)
-   RMF §4.2 (Identity Kernel Definition)

**Formal Alignment:**
-   MBC boxes = **relational operator containers**, not object stores.
-   Identity Kernel = **constraint over admissible MBC box networks**.
-   Semantic objects MUST be treated as **box-relation configurations**, not feature sets.

✅ Compliance Condition:
-   All semantic entities MUST be defined via box-relations, not boxed content.

❌ Non-Compliant MBC Usage:
-   Feature-vector identity models without relational operator structure.

---

### 11.4 IGSOA — Informational Ground State Ontological Asymmetry (Process Layer)

**RMF Mapping:**
-   RMF §6.1 (Process Invariance)
-   RMF §2.1 (First Difference as Relation)

**Formal Alignment:**
-   IGSOA defines Δ → Φ → Π as the **irreducible recursion of being**.
-   RMF enforces that identity, agency, and structure are **products of this recursion only**.

✅ Compliance Condition:
-   No document may bypass Δ → Φ → Π when deriving identity or agency.

❌ Non-Compliant IGSOA Usage:
-   Direct object creation without projection and evaluation stages.

---

### 11.5 DFVM — Dynamic Field Valence Mechanics (Flow Layer)

**RMF Mapping:**
-   RMF §6.2 (Instance Mortality)
-   RMF §7.1 (Time as Relational Ordering)

**Formal Alignment:**
-   DFVM governs **how relational fields propagate, damp, amplify, and collapse**.
-   RMF requires that **identity instances exist only as DFVM-sustained attractors**.

✅ Compliance Condition:
-   Identity persistence MUST be modeled as DFVM flow maintenance.

❌ Non-Compliant DFVM Usage:
-   Static identity models with no field dynamics.

---

### 11.6 SATP — Scale-Anchored Translation Protocol (Metric-Deformation Layer)

**RMF Mapping:**
-   RMF §7.1 (Time as Relational Ordering)
-   RMF §1.2 (Relational Primacy)

**Formal Alignment:**
-   SATP operates on **scale-relational deformation of metric structure**.
-   RMF requires that SATP reframing preserve **relational causality and non-object primacy**.

✅ Compliance Condition:
-   All SATP constructs MUST be expressed as relational scale transformations, not spatial teleportation.

❌ Non-Compliant SATP Usage:
-   Any formulation implying literal object displacement outside relational metric deformation.

---

## 12. Cross-Framework Consistency Rule (GLOBAL)

A document is **automatically RMF-INCOMPATIBLE** if it violates alignment at **any single layer** of:

MSP → MSC → MBC → IGSOA → DFVM → SATP

Because all six layers are **functionally dependent projections of the same monistic relational substrate**.
