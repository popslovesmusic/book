# Randomness Placement Log

## Actions
- Localized randomness to the DFVM layer in Quantum Stochastic Mechanics with formal stochastic term $\xi(x,t)$ and explicit bounds.
- Added capability/constraint table and defined Stochastic Overdrive failure mode tied to MSC damping capacity.
- Updated Unification & Synthesis summary to reflect canonical randomness placement and preserved MSC identity stabilization.

=======
- Added ontological leakage guard: any $\xi$ outside DFVM triggers hard-stop audit and containment before operations resume.
>>>>>>> theirs

## Compliance Notes
- No randomness introduced at MSP, MSC, or IGSOA; irreversibility and NOT axiom preserved.
- Randomness does not regenerate symmetry, act as an agent, or bypass MSC-mediated identity formation.
