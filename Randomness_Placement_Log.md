# Randomness Placement Log

## Actions
- Localized randomness to the DFVM layer in Quantum Stochastic Mechanics with formal stochastic term $\xi(x,t)$ and explicit bounds.
- Added capability/constraint table and defined Stochastic Overdrive failure mode tied to MSC damping capacity.
- Updated Unification & Synthesis summary to reflect canonical randomness placement and preserved MSC identity stabilization.

- Added ontological leakage guard: any $\xi$ outside DFVM triggers hard-stop audit and containment before operations resume.

- Added ontological leakage guard: any $\xi$ outside DFVM triggers hard-stop audit and containment before operations resume.
- Re-certified DFVM-only placement after adding explicit leakage hard-stop language in QSM and banning stochastic forcing from SATP formulations.

- Recorded master enforcement directive: $\xi$ must remain zero-mean, bounded, non-agentic, and irreversible; appearance in MSP, MSC, MBC, IGSOA, or SATP triggers immediate processing halt plus entries in this log and the Global Compliance Re-Audit.

## Compliance Notes
- No randomness introduced at MSP, MSC, or IGSOA; irreversibility and NOT axiom preserved.
- Randomness does not regenerate symmetry, act as an agent, or bypass MSC-mediated identity formation.
