# Global Compliance Re-Audit

## Scope
- Randomness localization updates (Quantum Stochastic Mechanics, Unification & Synthesis)
- Measurement operator formalization (MSC chapter)
- SATP well-posedness and stability hardening (Experimental Predictions, SATP appendices)

## Findings
- No RMF violations detected; relational primacy, non-essentialist identity, and irreversibility maintained.
- Randomness confined to DFVM stochastic modulation with no observer primacy or symmetry restoration.
- Measurement remains energetic and relational with $\Delta S_{entropy} > 0$; records require supercritical MSC.
- SATP constraints exclude superluminal propagation, time reversal, or free-energy loopholes via bounded gradients and CFL enforcement.
<<<<<<< ours
=======
- Cross-stack failure registry extended to include randomness leakage hard-stop condition with mandatory containment and audit logging.
