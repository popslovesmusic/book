# Global Compliance Re-Audit

## Scope
- Randomness localization updates (Quantum Stochastic Mechanics, Unification & Synthesis)
- Measurement operator formalization (MSC chapter)
- SATP well-posedness and stability hardening (Experimental Predictions, SATP appendices)
- Equation-level structural audit (MSC, DFVM stochasticity, measurement operator, SATP PDE/bounds, entropy link)

## Findings
- No RMF violations detected; relational primacy, non-essentialist identity, irreversibility, and NO observer primacy remain intact.
- Randomness confined to DFVM stochastic modulation with no symmetry restoration; any leakage beyond DFVM triggers a hard-stop audit.
- Measurement remains energetic and relational with $\Delta S_{entropy} > 0$; records require supercritical MSC and failures are audit-logged.
- Measurement mapping clarified as an observer-independent channel (CPTP/Markov kernel) with $\Delta E$ as dissipated heat/work and $\Delta S_{entropy} > 0$ as a thermodynamic constraint; persistent outputs occur only when the observability criterion is met.
- SATP constraints exclude superluminal propagation, time reversal, or free-energy loopholes via bounded gradients, CFL enforcement, and explicit stochastic exclusion.
- Cross-stack failure registry updated to monitor randomness leakage, MSC decay, DFVM runaway, and SATP wall failure with hard-stop escalation paths.
- Master enforcement directive reaffirmed: $\xi$ observed outside DFVM or stochastic forcing within SATP mandates immediate halt, log entry, and recertification.
- Layer consistency scan executed via ontological_consistency_report.md; no active violations detected, with potential legacy $\xi$ references flagged for manual review.
- Equation structural audit executed: confirmed MSC functional/regimes, DFVM update, measurement operator, entropy link, and SATP PDE/CFL/cost inequalities all compare like quantities with hyperbolic classification retained and no randomness leakage or observer primacy reintroduction.
- Limiting sanity checks recorded: SATP wave-limit reduction preserves hyperbolic/CFL governance; MSC cohesion responds monotonically to $\rho_{rel}$ vs. $\sigma_{pert}$ extremes; entropy growth tracks cohesion decay without violating irreversibility or identity constraints.
- MSC functional domain clarified with an $H^1(\Omega)$ exemplar, illustrating admissible $\rho_{rel}$ and $\sigma_{pert}$ choices and norm-based regime thresholds while keeping identity non-essentialist and collapse = cohesion loss.
- Math_Rigour_Status.json5 generated to tag key claims (randomness placement, measurement irreversibility, MSC cohesion, SATP bounds) as asserted or sketched, highlighting proof gaps without altering locked constraints.
- Added SATP regularity and potential-growth assumptions, an energy functional with a source-dominated $\tfrac{dE}{dt}$ bound, and a CFL explanation tied to discrete energy control; no stochastic forcing, observer primacy, or symmetry restoration introduced.
- Formalized DFVM stochasticity on $(\Omega, \mathcal{F}, \mathbb{P})$ with discrete and Itô SPDE forms using bounded, zero-mean noise; MSC remains responsive only through DFVM coupling and stochastic terms stay excluded from MSP, MBC, IGSOA, and SATP.
- math_audit_and_rigor_upgrade.py generated refreshed symbol and math-object indices, a consistency report with stochastic-leakage and observer-primacy checks, an updated rigour-status map, and a rigor-upgrade plan—all without altering core sources—to maintain DFVM-only randomness, irreversible measurement, and SATP hyperbolic locks.

## Cross-Stack Failure Monitoring (Active)
| Failure | Layer | Trigger | Response |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Randomness leakage | Ontological | $\xi$ outside DFVM | Hard stop + containment audit |
| MSC decay | Structural | $S_{MSC} \rightarrow 0$ | Identity dissolution classification + log |
| DFVM runaway | Dynamical | Inadequate damping | Turbulence saturation alert |
| SATP wall failure | Physical | Gradient blow-up | Translation loss flag + CFL review |

## Recertification
- Irreversibility: $\Delta S_{entropy} > 0$ enforced in measurement and transport; no time reversal permitted.
- Identity non-essentialism: MSC attractor model preserved; collapse = cohesion loss without transfer.
- Observer exclusion: No observer primacy or intrinsic knower introduced; records are relational and MSC-gated.
- Symmetry restoration bans remain in force across MSP $\rightarrow$ SATP.
- Randomness governance: DFVM-only stochastic modulation with zero-mean, bounded, non-agentic $\xi$; leakage triggers logs in the Randomness Placement Log and SATP exclusions reverified.

Quantum Memory Matrix (QMM) Status Declaration
QMM is a legacy reference artifact retained solely for historical or illustrative purposes. It is not a foundational component of the MSP → MSC → MBC → IGSOA → DFVM → SATP stack and carries no axiomatic, mathematical, ontological, or causal authority within this framework. Any reference to QMM is strictly non-binding and may not be used as a derivation source, dependency, or proof substrate.
