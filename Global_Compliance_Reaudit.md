# Global Compliance Re-Audit

## Scope
- Randomness localization updates (Quantum Stochastic Mechanics, Unification & Synthesis)
- Measurement operator formalization (MSC chapter)
- SATP well-posedness and stability hardening (Experimental Predictions, SATP appendices)

## Findings
<<<<<<< ours
- No RMF violations detected; relational primacy, non-essentialist identity, and irreversibility maintained.
- Randomness confined to DFVM stochastic modulation with no observer primacy or symmetry restoration.
- Measurement remains energetic and relational with $\Delta S_{entropy} > 0$; records require supercritical MSC.
- SATP constraints exclude superluminal propagation, time reversal, or free-energy loopholes via bounded gradients and CFL enforcement.
<<<<<<< ours
=======
- Cross-stack failure registry extended to include randomness leakage hard-stop condition with mandatory containment and audit logging.
>>>>>>> theirs
=======
- No RMF violations detected; relational primacy, non-essentialist identity, irreversibility, and NO observer primacy remain intact.
- Randomness confined to DFVM stochastic modulation with no symmetry restoration; any leakage beyond DFVM triggers a hard-stop audit.
- Measurement remains energetic and relational with $\Delta S_{entropy} > 0$; records require supercritical MSC and failures are audit-logged.
- SATP constraints exclude superluminal propagation, time reversal, or free-energy loopholes via bounded gradients, CFL enforcement, and explicit stochastic exclusion.
- Cross-stack failure registry updated to monitor randomness leakage, MSC decay, DFVM runaway, and SATP wall failure with hard-stop escalation paths.

## Cross-Stack Failure Monitoring (Active)
| Failure | Layer | Trigger | Response |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Randomness leakage | Ontological | $\xi$ outside DFVM | Hard stop + containment audit |
| MSC decay | Structural | $S_{MSC} \rightarrow 0$ | Identity dissolution classification + log |
| DFVM runaway | Dynamical | Inadequate damping | Turbulence saturation alert |
| SATP wall failure | Physical | Gradient blow-up | Translation loss flag + CFL review |

## Recertification
- Irreversibility: $\Delta S_{entropy} > 0$ enforced in measurement and transport; no time reversal permitted.
- Identity non-essentialism: MSC attractor model preserved; collapse = cohesion loss without transfer.
- Observer exclusion: No observer primacy or intrinsic knower introduced; records are relational and MSC-gated.
- Symmetry restoration bans remain in force across MSP → SATP.
