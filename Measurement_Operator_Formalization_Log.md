# Measurement Operator Formalization Log

## Actions
- Introduced formal measurement operator $\mathcal{M} : (DFVM, MSC) \rightarrow (\Psi_{record}, \Delta E, \Delta S_{entropy})$ with $\Delta S_{entropy} > 0$.
- Added record stability condition $S_{MSC}(\Psi_{record}) > \varepsilon_2$ and failure modes table covering decoherence, backreaction, and entropic flooding.
- Updated the Semantic → Physical Bridge summary to tie observability to irreversible records and MSC thresholds.

## Compliance Notes
- No observer primacy, intrinsic knower, or wavefunction metaphysics introduced; measurement remains energetic, relational, and irreversible.
- MSC continues as cohesion mechanism; identity and memory remain non-essentialist and relational.
