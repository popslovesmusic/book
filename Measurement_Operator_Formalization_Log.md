# Measurement Operator Formalization Log

## Actions
- Introduced formal measurement operator $\mathcal{M} : (DFVM, MSC) \rightarrow (\Psi_{record}, \Delta E, \Delta S_{entropy})$ with $\Delta S_{entropy} > 0$.
- Added record stability condition $S_{MSC}(\Psi_{record}) > \varepsilon_2$ and failure modes table covering decoherence, backreaction, and entropic flooding.
- Updated the Semantic → Physical Bridge summary to tie observability to irreversible records and MSC thresholds.

- Re-certified measurement governance under the master directive: no observer primacy, no entropy-neutral paths, and mandatory logging of decoherence, backreaction runaway, or entropic flooding with links to Global Compliance Re-Audit.

- Added layer consistency audit sweep to confirm measurement mentions remain observer-independent, energetic, and irreversible with $\Delta S_{entropy} > 0$.
- Ran equation-level structural audit verifying $\mathcal{M}$ domain/codomain pairing, $\Delta S_{entropy} > 0$ irreversibility, and MSC-thresholded record stability remain type-consistent and observer-independent.

- Confirmed the new SATP energy and regularity assumptions do not alter measurement governance: $\Delta S_{entropy} > 0$ remains mandatory, and observer-independent records stay MSC-gated.

## Compliance Notes
- No observer primacy, intrinsic knower, or wavefunction metaphysics introduced; measurement remains energetic, relational, and irreversible.
- MSC continues as cohesion mechanism; identity and memory remain non-essentialist and relational.
