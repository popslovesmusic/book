# SATP Well-Posedness Log

## Actions
- Added hyperbolic well-posedness conditions, CFL stability bound, energy/cost constraint, and failure modes to Experimental Predictions.
- Authored SATP_Final_PDE_Formulation.md capturing PDE form, bounds, and failure matrix.
- Created SATP_CFL_Stability_Appendix.md with operational CFL guidance and diagnostics.

## RMF Compliance
- Preserved irreversibility and excluded symmetry restoration or time reversal.
- No superluminal or free-energy loopholes introduced; NEC-style constraints respected via bounded gradients and costs.
