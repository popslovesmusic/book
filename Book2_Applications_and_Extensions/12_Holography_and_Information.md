## **Part I — Conceptual and Mathematical Framework**

### **12.1 Introduction and Motivation**

This paper proposes that **biological and cognitive systems** are information sinks where memory condenses into structure, sustained by causal feedback against the global thermodynamic gradient. Within the IGSOA–QMM framework, life and cognition are *feedback stabilization* of causal memory diffusion. An organism is a **phase-locked replica** of the universal causal spiral, tuned to maintain local coherence.

### **12.2 Fractional Thermodynamics of Local Order**

A **causal negentropy condition** for self-organization is defined, where a local decrease in entropy is balanced by an external injection of energy. Living systems are characterized by an **effective fractional order** `γ_eff < 1`, indicating slower entropy growth and persistent pattern memory.

### **12.3 Mathematical Model of Phase Mirroring**

Biological phase space is modeled by two coupled fractional-spiral fields. Their mutual coupling forms a **phase mirror**, where energy dissipated by one spiral is absorbed by its conjugate, maintaining net coherence. This models metabolic or neural feedback.

### **12.4 Information Geometry and Cognitive Manifolds**

A Fisher-like metric on causal probabilities defines an information distance. Cognitive efficiency corresponds to geodesic motion on this manifold, minimizing fractional action and entropy production. This provides a physical meaning for intelligence as optimal causal adaptation. Biological and cognitive structures are seen as a **hierarchical spiral embedding**, producing scale-free forms.

## **Part II — Thermodynamic Life Criteria and Anthropic Reflection**

### **12.5 Thermodynamic Criteria for Life and Cognition**

Life requires a local entropy balance where entropy is exported to the environment. A **thermodynamic viability threshold** is defined based on metabolic rate, which is consistent with the observed energy efficiency of living systems.

### **12.6 Cognitive Entropy and Information Exchange**

The entropy of neural or computational states is defined, with fractional order `γ < 1` implying long-memory correlations, the physiological substrate of learning. A **causal learning equation** is proposed, where intelligence corresponds to regulated entropy flux. Synchronization between interacting systems is described as phase-locked causal mirroring.

### **12.7 Observational and Experimental Correlations**

The paper presents a table of observational and experimental correlations across biophysical, neural, cognitive, and ecological domains. The fractional order `γ` is consistently found to be in the range of 0.9–0.98, suggesting universal fractional memory laws governing self-organization.

### **12.8 Philosophical Synthesis — The Anthropic Mirror**

The Anthropic Mirror principle states that any system capable of recording its own causal state necessarily forms a mirror of the universe’s memory. Each observer is a self-stabilized spiral within the universal spiral. Cognition is the geometry of recursive memory, not subjective experience, and fundamentally arises from causal self-reference. The anthropic state is a phase where the universe’s causal echo becomes locally self-aware.

## **Appendices**

### **Appendix A — Fractional Thermodynamic Equations of Living Systems**

This appendix details the fractional energy and entropy balance equations for open living systems. It establishes a steady-state condition for life where entropy is exported at the same rate it is produced internally. It also introduces fractional Onsager relations and defines a fractional negentropy flux.

### **Appendix B — Information-Geometric Thermodynamics**

This appendix presents a thermodynamic formalism based on information geometry. A fractional Fisher metric is defined on the space of state probabilities, and the geodesic motion on this manifold is identified with cognitive adaptation and learning. This framework connects the curvature of the information manifold to causal temperature.

### **Appendix C — Quantitative Observables and Experimental Contexts**

This appendix provides a list of quantitative observables and experimental contexts for testing the theory. It includes predictions for biophysical measurements (ATP hydrolysis), neural dynamics (EEG/MEG spectra), cognitive timing experiments, and synthetic AI networks. It highlights the numerical continuity between the fractional orders observed in biological and cosmological systems.
