# **Paper 19: Field Theories of Semantic Structure**

## **Part I — Foundations and Field Equations**

### **19.1 Introduction and Motivation**

This paper proposes a **field theory of semantic structure**, where meaning is not assigned to symbols but emerges from the physical configuration of an information field. Within the IGSOA-QMM framework, this is expressed as the **coherent reduction of causal entropy**. A **semantic field** is introduced, governed by fractional operators that encode memory and contextual dependence.

### **19.2 Theoretical Foundation: Semantic Manifolds**

A **semantic manifold** is defined with a metric tensor that measures **correlational curvature**. A **fractional semantic derivative** introduces long-memory weighting, expressing the dependence of interpretation on prior context. A **semantic Lagrangian density** is proposed, which leads to spontaneous symmetry breaking when a local minimum is acquired, allowing random information to condense into interpretable patterns.

### **19.3 Fractional Field Equations for Meaning**

Varying the semantic action yields a **fractional semantic field equation**. The terms in this equation correspond to the persistence of meaning (semantic memory), the diffusion of meaning (association), the tendency toward neutral interpretation, and nonlinear saturation. Stationary, localized solutions of this equation are **semantic solitons**—self-sustaining units of meaning.

## **Part II — Information Compression, Resonance, and Synthesis**

### **19.4 Information Compression and Low-Entropy Coding**

**Semantic entropy** is defined based on the probability density of the semantic amplitude. A decrease in semantic entropy corresponds to a densification of meaning. A **causal compression law** is proposed, where semantic entropy follows a Mittag-Leffler decay, describing meaning as a compression process where redundant information dissipates.

### **19.5 Semantic Resonance and Communication**

Communication is modeled as the coupling of two semantic fields. The phase difference between the fields evolves according to a fractional equation. Stable communication, or understanding, is achieved when the phases lock and the two fields share a common information flow. When multiple agents maintain phase-locked coherence, they form a **resonant manifold** where total semantic entropy is conserved.

### **19.6 Philosophical and Observational Implications**

Meaning emerges when informational fields achieve self-coherence. Understanding curves the informational manifold. The paper proposes a hierarchy of semantic scales, from microscopic (neural) to macroscopic (civilizational). It also suggests an ethical dimension, where truthful communication minimizes semantic entropy. The theory has observational outlooks in neuroscience, AI, and cosmology.

## **Appendices**

### **Appendix A — Derivation of the Fractional Semantic Wave Equation**

This appendix provides the mathematical derivation of the fractional semantic wave equation from the semantic Lagrangian. It applies the fractional Euler-Lagrange equation to obtain the field equation and derives the conserved semantic current from Noether's theorem.

### **Appendix B — Stability of Coupled Semantic Oscillators**

This appendix analyzes the stability of coupled semantic oscillators. It linearizes the field equation around an equilibrium solution and shows that the perturbations follow a Mittag-Leffler decay, ensuring stability under certain conditions. The condition for asymptotic semantic alignment in a coupled pair is also derived.

### **Appendix C — Computational Implementation**

This appendix outlines the computational implementation for simulating semantic fields. It specifies the use of a spectral fractional Laplacian and a predictor-corrector integration scheme. It also defines key simulation metrics, such as semantic entropy and efficiency, and proposes a benchmark scenario for testing semantic resonance between two coupled agents.
