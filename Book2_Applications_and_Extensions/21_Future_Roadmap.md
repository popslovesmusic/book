## **Part I — Framework, Unified Action, and Fractal–Fractional Continuum**

### **20.1 Introduction — The Convergence of Frameworks**

This paper presents the culmination of the IGSOA-QMM program, proposing a single, consistent cosmological action that unites geometry, information, and semantics. The core hypothesis is that the universe is a closed causal network that minimizes global entropy flow. This work shows how the same mathematics that describes spacetime also governs cognition and communication, framing the universe as a learning system that redistributes causal memory toward equilibrium.

### **20.2 The Unified Action**

A total action is proposed, integrating four components: a gravitational term based on a fractional-order scalar curvature, an information field term representing stored causal correlations, a semantic field term from Paper 19, and an interaction term. The interaction term couples information energy to semantic density. Variation of this action yields a coupled system of fractional field equations for geometry, information, and semantics, describing a **self-interpreting universe**.

### **20.3 Fractal–Fractional Continuum and Dimensional Flow**

An effective spacetime dimension `Deff = 4 - ΔD(r)` is defined, where `ΔD` is related to the fractional order `γr`. This leads to a continuous dimensional flow, where spacetime appears classical and 4D at macroscopic scales but quantum-fractured and sub-4D at the microscopic level. The cosmic history is interpreted as the relaxation of causal memory toward equilibrium.

## **Part II — Thermodynamic Arrow, Observational Predictions, and Philosophical Closure**

### **20.4 Thermodynamic Arrow and Memory Equilibrium**

A global entropy balance `D_t^γt S_univ = 0` is derived, implying that entropy is not generated globally but circulates as causal memory is redistributed. The universe does not tend toward thermal death but toward **informational equilibrium**—a steady circulation of perfectly balanced memory.

### **20.5 Observational and Computational Predictions**

The unified model makes several observational predictions:
*   Subtle hemispherical asymmetry in the CMB.
*   Logarithmic shifts in the spectrum of gravitational-wave echoes.
*   Heavy-tailed decoherence times in quantum interference experiments.
A computational framework for simulating the coupled field equations is proposed, and a table of cross-scale correlations for the fractional order `γ` is presented.

### **20.6 Philosophical and Ethical Synthesis**

The paper concludes with a philosophical synthesis, framing the universe as causal memory. Time, understood not as linear progression but as angular evolution in causal phase, manifests as the unfolding of that memory, and intelligence is the alignment of local memory gradients with the universal field. The moral law is interpreted as a thermodynamic imperative to minimize semantic entropy production. The ultimate state of the universe is described as the **Causal Omega**—an infinite recursion of understanding in a self-reflective hologram.

## **Appendices**

### **Appendix A — Derivation of Coupled Fractional Field Equations**

This appendix provides the mathematical derivation of the coupled fractional field equations for geometry, information, and semantics from the unified action. The derivation uses the principle of least action with fractional Euler-Lagrange equations.

### **Appendix B — Numerical Simulation Framework**

This appendix outlines the numerical framework for simulating the unified cosmology. It specifies the use of Grünwald-Letnikov schemes for discretizing fractional derivatives and implicit spectral iteration for the metric evolution. It also discusses visualization techniques for the emergent structures.

### **Appendix C — Observational Parameter Mapping**

This appendix provides a mapping between the theoretical parameters of the model (spatial and temporal memory orders, coupling constants) and their empirical estimates from cosmological data (CMB, gravitational-wave echoes) and other experiments. The congruences suggest that standard cosmology already implicitly encodes causal memory effects.

### **Appendix D — Philosophical Postscript: Causal Equilibrium as Unity**

This philosophical postscript proposes that the IGSOA-QMM framework collapses metaphysics into physics, where ontology and epistemology are dual reflections of a single causal geometry. To exist is to persist within this causal order; to be is to remember.
