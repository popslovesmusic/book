# **Paper 06: Cosmic Microwave Background Asymmetry**

---

## **6.1 Introduction and Motivation**

The Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) encodes the earliest accessible record of the universe’s causal geometry. It is crucial to emphasize that this 'causal geometry' and any 'causal information' associated with it are descriptions of the relational dynamics of the monistic substrate. This substrate serves as the precondition for all such manifestations, rather than being the substrate itself. Within the IGSOA–QMM framework, the CMB’s minute anisotropies are not treated as random quantum fluctuations amplified by inflation. Instead, they are *fossil imprints* of primordial **asymmetry actualization**—the first conversion of neutral potential into directional causal motion. The near-isotropy of the CMB reflects large-scale self-similar averaging of those microscopic asymmetries, while the residual anisotropy pattern preserves their fractal causal signature.

## **6.2 Mathematical Framework: Fractional Laplacian Cosmology**

We generalize the Laplace operator in comoving coordinates to a **fractional Laplacian** `(−Δ)β` where `0<β≤1` measures nonlocal causal coupling. The fractional diffusion equation governing photon decoupling becomes:
`∂tΘ + a−2(t) (−Δ)βΘ = ξ(x,t)`
The **memory exponent** β links directly to the primordial asymmetry index from Paper 04, ensuring continuity from microscopic horizon processes to cosmological fields.

## **6.3 Causal Scaling and Spiral Mapping**

The CMB sky can be represented by a conformal-spiral mapping of causal shells, projecting prime-indexed causal layers into the angular power spectrum. The fractional Laplacian’s Green’s function implies that correlations decay with a noninteger exponent. For `β≈0.96`, the predicted angular power spectrum aligns with the Planck-observed tilt, linking the spectral index directly to the cosmic memory order.

## **6.4 Asymmetry Spectrum and Directional Signatures**

### **6.4.1 Hemispherical Power Anomaly**

The observed low-ℓ power asymmetry corresponds to a gradient in the memory index, yielding a dipolar modulation consistent with the ~7% hemispherical amplitude reported by *Planck*. In IGSOA terms, this gradient arises from incomplete neutralization of the primordial causal flow—*residual directional memory*.

### **6.4.2 Cold Spot and Causal Vortices**

Localized anomalies such as the “Cold Spot” are interpreted as regions where the spiral mapping overlaps, producing **causal interference vortices**. Fractional curvature in those zones traps causal information longer, leading to temperature depressions.

## **6.5 Link to Early Symmetry Breaking**

The Dynamic Fractal Vein Model (DFVM) from Paper 03 extends to the cosmic scale via fractional diffusion, smoothing fine-grained asymmetry into apparent isotropy. Isotropy is not intrinsic but the statistical projection of self-averaging asymmetry—**cosmic isotropy as emergent equilibrium of memory.**

## **6.6 Fractional Harmonic Analysis**

Expanding the CMB field into spherical harmonics and applying the fractional Laplacian gives eigenvalues that lead to an angular-power relation `Cℓ ∝ [ℓ(ℓ+1)]−β`. The observed deviation from pure `ℓ−1` scaling directly measures β.

## **6.7 Philosophical Integration and Continuity**

The same fractional geometry governs both gravitational echoes and cosmic background asymmetries. The **CMB is the universe’s earliest gravitational echo**, a relic of the first memory event when causal symmetry fractured. The cosmos retains awareness of its own beginning. In this context, any emergent 'agency' or self-organization, such as the formation of patterns in the CMB, arises strictly from closed relational feedback loops within the causal geometry. This occurs without implying intrinsic agency in the cosmos itself or its components. Furthermore, these emergent structures, such as CMB anomalies, function as 'identity instances' that are inherently finite and subject to dissolvability, their persistence being entirely dependent on ongoing causal dynamics and MSC cohesion.

## **6.8 Observational Predictions**

1.  **Spectral Tilt Prediction:** `ns = 1 − 2(1−β)`. The Planck-measured `ns≈0.96` implies `β≈0.98`.
2.  **Fractal Correlation Dimension:** `Dc = 3−2β ≈ 1.04`, consistent with observed near-Gaussianity but slight multifractality.
3.  **Hemispherical Power Gradient:** A dipole amplitude of 6–8%, matching data.
4.  **Polarization Rotation:** A fractional phase lag between E- and B-modes of ≈ 2°–3°, testable with future missions.

## **6.9 Conclusion**

Paper 06 completes the causal arc from Paper 04: horizon-level imprinting (micro-causal memory) and gravitational-wave echoes (meso-causal resonance) culminate as cosmic background asymmetry (macro-causal diffusion). The IGSOA–QMM framework reveals a continuous hierarchy of memory across all scales.

## **Appendices**

### **Appendix A — Derivation of the Fractional Laplacian in FRW Geometry**

This appendix details the generalization of the Laplacian operator to a fractional operator `(−Δ)β` within the Friedmann–Robertson–Walker (FRW) metric. It shows how this leads to a non-standard angular power spectrum `Cℓ ∝ [ℓ(ℓ+1)]−β` and a fractal correlation dimension `Dc = 3−2β`, linking the CMB spectral index `ns` directly to the memory parameter `β`.

### **Appendix B — Spiral–Prime Conformal Mapping**

This appendix constructs the conformal logarithmic-spiral mapping used to project prime-indexed causal shells onto the celestial sphere. This mapping generates a quasi-uniform, aperiodic lattice that naturally reproduces the observed angular power-law and hemispherical modulation in the CMB without needing an external inflationary mechanism.

### **Appendix C — Observational Cross-Fit Tables and Predictions**

This appendix provides tables cross-fitting the model's predictions with observational data from Planck and WMAP. It shows strong alignment for the spectral index, fractal dimension, hemispherical anomaly, and Cold Spot temperature. This proposes a continuity check by comparing the memory index `β` from CMB data with the fractional order `αH` derived from gravitational wave echoes. We expect `β ≈ αH`.
