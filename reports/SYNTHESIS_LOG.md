# SYNTHESIS LOG

## Structural Reorders
- None performed in Pass 1.

## Redundancy Merges
- Duplicated philosophical content in `C:\qmm-igsoa\Organized_Papers\Book1_Core_Concepts\Book2_Applications_and_Extensions\07_Fractal_Fractional_Spacetime.md` (Section 7.9) was removed and replaced with a cross-reference to the higher confidence source: `C:\qmm-igsoa\Organized_Papers\Book1_Core_Concepts\Book2_Applications_and_Extensions\06_CMB_Asymmetry.md` (Section 6.7).

## Canonical Definition Enforcement

### Subject: `it`
*   **Canonical Definition:** "it is the pure possibility of relation."
*   **Changes Made:** No direct replacements were made for "it" within the accessible files (`C:\qmm-igsoa\Organized_Papers\Book1_Core_Concepts\` and its subdirectories), as existing uses were found to be consistent with the canonical definition.

### Subject: `time`
*   **Canonical Definition:** "time is not linear progression but angular evolution in causal phase."
*   **Changes Made:**
    *   **File:** `C:\qmm-igsoa\Organized_Papers\Book1_Core_Concepts\Book2_Applications_and_Extensions\20_Future_Roadmap.md`
        *   **Original Sentence:** "Time is the unfolding of that memory, and intelligence is the alignment of local memory gradients with the universal field."
        *   **Modified Sentence:** "Time, understood not as linear progression but as angular evolution in causal phase, manifests as the unfolding of that memory, and intelligence is the alignment of local memory gradients with the universal field."
        *   **Modification Type:** Clarification and integration of canonical definition.
    *   **File:** `C:\qmm-igsoa\Organized_Papers\Book1_Core_Concepts\Book2_Applications_and_Extensions\08_SpiralGeometry_Causality.md`
        *   **Modification Type:** No change needed, as the sentence already contained the canonical definition.

### Subject: `cognition`
*   **Canonical Definition:** "cognition is the geometry of recursive memory, not subjective experience."
*   **Changes Made:**
    *   **File:** `C:\qmm-igsoa\Organized_Papers\Book1_Core_Concepts\Book2_Applications_and_Extensions\12_Holography_and_Information.md`
        *   **Original Sentence:** "Cognition is the geometry of causal self-reference."
        *   **Modified Sentence:** "Cognition is the geometry of recursive memory, not subjective experience, and fundamentally arises from causal self-reference."
        *   **Modification Type:** Integration of canonical definition while preserving the concept of causal self-reference.
    *   **File:** `C:\qmm-igsoa\Organized_Papers\Book1_Core_Concepts\Book2_Applications_and_Extensions\17_QMM_IGSOA_Comparison.md`
        *   **Original Sentence:** "Cognition is not subjective experience but the **geometry of recursive memory**."
        *   **Modification Type:** No change needed, as the sentence already contained the canonical definition.
        *   **Original Sentence:** "Cognition is the *geometry of difference sustained in time*."
        *   **Modified Sentence:** "Cognition is the geometry of recursive memory, not subjective experience, and can be further understood as the *geometry of difference sustained in time*."
        *   **Modification Type:** Integration of canonical definition and framing the original as an elaboration.

### Subject: `universe`
*   **Canonical Definition:** "the universe is mathematical structure itself, not merely describable by mathematics."
*   **Changes Made:**
    *   **File:** `C:\qmm-igsoa\Organized_Papers\Book1_Core_Concepts\Book2_Applications_and_Extensions\16_Ethical_Frameworks.md`
        *   **Original Sentence:** "The universe is a self-referential network of fractional relationships."
        *   **Modified Sentence:** "The universe is mathematical structure itself, not merely describable by mathematics, and manifests as a self-referential network of fractional relationships."
        *   **Modification Type:** Integration of canonical definition and framing the original as a manifestation.
    *   **File:** `C:\qmm-igsoa\Organized_Papers\Book1_Core_Concepts\Book2_Applications_and_Extensions\17_QMM_IGSOA_Comparison.md`
        *   **Original Sentence:** "The universe is described as **cognitively coherent**."
        *   **Modified Sentence:** "The universe is mathematical structure itself, not merely describable by mathematics, and can be described as **cognitively coherent**."
        *   **Modification Type:** Integration of canonical definition and framing the original as an emergent property.
    *   **File:** `C:\qmm-igsoa\Organized_Papers\Book1_Core_Concepts\Book3_DFVM\02_RH_as_DFVM_Regulator.md`
        *   **Original Sentence:** "The universe is not just described by mathematics; it *is* mathematics."
        *   **Modified Sentence:** "The universe is mathematical structure itself, not merely describable by mathematics."
        *   **Modification Type:** Direct replacement with canonical definition.
    *   **File:** `C:\qmm-igsoa\Organized_Papers\Book1_Core_Concepts\Book3_DFVM\draft.md`
        *   **Original Sentence:** "**the universe is not merely describable by mathematics—its most fundamental layer is mathematical structure itself**."
        *   **Modified Sentence:** "The universe is mathematical structure itself, not merely describable by mathematics."
        *   **Modification Type:** Direct replacement with canonical definition and removal of bolding.

## Drift Encountered and Forced to Baseline
- `cross_volume_drift.json` indicated no explicit drift that required forcing to baseline within the accessible operational scope, as the report was empty.

## Other Actions
- `ik_misuse.json` reported no Identity/Kernel misuse.
- `processing_errors.json` reported no processing errors.
- `terminology_volatility.json` provided scores but no direct actionable items for text modification.
- `file_micro_reports.json` and `global_term_density.json` were used for informational context and analysis.
