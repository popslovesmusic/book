# Normalization Log

This log details the canonicalizations performed to ensure ontological consistency across the corpus, specifically addressing negation conflicts identified in `logic_contradictions.json` within the accessible working directory (`C:\qmm-igsoa\Organized_Papers\Book1_Core_Concepts\` and its subdirectories).

## Subject: `it`
**Canonical Definition:** "it is the pure possibility of relation."
**Rationale:** This definition best captures the fundamental nature of the monistic substrate, which is beyond direct physical attributes and serves as the potential for all relations.
**Changes Made:**
*   No direct replacements were made for "it" within the accessible files. Upon review, all existing uses of "it" within these files (often referring to the monistic substrate) were found to be consistent with the canonical definition, either describing properties, processes, or acting as grammatical placeholders without contradicting the core ontological definition.

## Subject: `time`
**Canonical Definition:** "time is not linear progression but angular evolution in causal phase."
**Rationale:** This definition positions time as a fundamental, process-primary dynamic within the causal field, aligning with the broader framework's emphasis on relational dynamics and emergent properties. The concept of "unfolding of memory" is viewed as a manifestation of this fundamental angular evolution.
**Changes Made:**
*   **File:** `C:\qmm-igsoa\Organized_Papers\Book1_Core_Concepts\Book2_Applications_and_Extensions\20_Future_Roadmap.md`
    *   **Original Sentence:** "Time is the unfolding of that memory, and intelligence is the alignment of local memory gradients with the universal field."
    *   **Modified Sentence:** "Time, understood not as linear progression but as angular evolution in causal phase, manifests as the unfolding of that memory, and intelligence is the alignment of local memory gradients with the universal field."
    *   **Modification Type:** Clarification and integration of canonical definition.
*   **File:** `C:\qmm-igsoa\Organized_Papers\Book1_Core_Concepts\Book2_Applications_and_Extensions\08_SpiralGeometry_Causality.md`
    *   **Original Sentence:** "time is not linear progression but angular evolution in causal phase, ...space is the radial unfolding of that phase."
    *   **Modification Type:** No change needed, as the sentence already contained the canonical definition.

## Subject: `cognition`
**Canonical Definition:** "cognition is the geometry of recursive memory, not subjective experience."
**Rationale:** This definition directly addresses a common misconception (cognition as subjective experience) and defines it in terms of "geometry" and "recursive memory," which are consistent with the causal and relational nature of the framework.
**Changes Made:**
*   **File:** `C:\qmm-igsoa\Organized_Papers\Book1_Core_Concepts\Book2_Applications_and_Extensions\12_Holography_and_Information.md`
    *   **Original Sentence:** "Cognition is the geometry of causal self-reference."
    *   **Modified Sentence:** "Cognition is the geometry of recursive memory, not subjective experience, and fundamentally arises from causal self-reference."
    *   **Modification Type:** Integration of canonical definition while preserving the concept of causal self-reference.
*   **File:** `C:\qmm-igsoa\Organized_Papers\Book1_Core_Concepts\Book2_Applications_and_Extensions\17_QMM_IGSOA_Comparison.md`
    *   **Original Sentence:** "Cognition is not subjective experience but the **geometry of recursive memory**."
    *   **Modification Type:** No change needed, as the sentence already contained the canonical definition.
*   **File:** `C:\qmm-igsoa\Organized_Papers\Book1_Core_Concepts\Book2_Applications_and_Extensions\17_QMM_IGSOA_Comparison.md`
    *   **Original Sentence:** "Cognition is the *geometry of difference sustained in time*."
    *   **Modified Sentence:** "Cognition is the geometry of recursive memory, not subjective experience, and can be further understood as the *geometry of difference sustained in time*."
    *   **Modification Type:** Integration of canonical definition and framing the original as an elaboration.

## Subject: `universe`
**Canonical Definition:** "the universe is mathematical structure itself, not merely describable by mathematics."
**Rationale:** This definition provides a foundational understanding of the universe's nature, aligning with a process-primary ontology where fundamental reality is abstract and generative.
**Changes Made:**
*   **File:** `C:\qmm-igsoa\Organized_Papers\Book1_Core_Concepts\Book2_Applications_and_Extensions\16_Ethical_Frameworks.md`
    *   **Original Sentence:** "The universe is a self-referential network of fractional relationships."
    *   **Modified Sentence:** "The universe is mathematical structure itself, not merely describable by mathematics, and manifests as a self-referential network of fractional relationships."
    *   **Modification Type:** Integration of canonical definition and framing the original as a manifestation.
*   **File:** `C:\qmm-igsoa\Organized_Papers\Book1_Core_Concepts\Book2_Applications_and_Extensions\17_QMM_IGSOA_Comparison.md`
    *   **Original Sentence:** "The universe is described as **cognitively coherent**."
    *   **Modified Sentence:** "The universe is mathematical structure itself, not merely describable by mathematics, and can be described as **cognitively coherent**."
    *   **Modification Type:** Integration of canonical definition and framing the original as an emergent property.
*   **File:** `C:\qmm-igsoa\Organized_Papers\Book1_Core_Concepts\Book3_DFVM\02_RH_as_DFVM_Regulator.md`
    *   **Original Sentence:** "The universe is not just described by mathematics; it *is* mathematics."
    *   **Modified Sentence:** "The universe is mathematical structure itself, not merely describable by mathematics."
    *   **Modification Type:** Direct replacement with canonical definition.
*   **File:** `C:\qmm-igsoa\Organized_Papers\Book1_Core_Concepts\Book3_DFVM\draft.md`
    *   **Original Sentence:** "**the universe is not merely describable by mathematics—its most fundamental layer is mathematical structure itself**."
    *   **Modified Sentence:** "The universe is mathematical structure itself, not merely describable by mathematics."
    *   **Modification Type:** Direct replacement with canonical definition and removal of bolding.

## Reviewed `definition_collisions.json` (No New Canonicalizations)
Upon review of `definition_collisions.json` entries within the accessible directories (similarity >= 0.45), no instances were found where direct canonicalization by replacing one predicate with another was necessary. The high similarity scores mostly indicated complementary statements rather than redundant or contradictory definitions requiring forced unification beyond the `logic_contradictions.json` resolutions. Semantic content was preserved in all cases.
